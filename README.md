# Requirements ‚úÖ
This guide will walk you through the steps to build this dashboard from scratch using the provided dummy data.

### Step 1: Design the Dashboard Mockup
Before creating the actual data visualization report, create a mockup/wireframe to define the layout, charts, and key metrics you want to display.

<pre>
- Use a diagramming/wireframing tool such as <a href="https://app.diagrams.net/" target="_blank">diagrams.net</a> or alternatives like Figma/Excalidraw.

- Include the intended KPIs (e.g., total revenue, orders), chart types (e.g., time series, bar, pie), filters (e.g., date range, category), and overall layout.

- Export or save the mockup (PNG/PDF) so you can reference it while building the report.
</pre>

### Step 2: Prepare the Data Source assets
First, you need to get the data into a format that Looker Studio can easily connect to. We'll use Google Sheets for this.

<pre>
- Download the <a href="assets/Dataset.csv">Dataset.csv</a> file from this repository.

- Go to <a href="https://sheets.google.com" target="_blank">Google Sheets</a> and create a new blank spreadsheet.

- In the new spreadsheet, go to File > Import.

- Select the Upload tab and choose the .csv file you just downloaded. Leave the import options as default and click Import data.

- Rename the spreadsheet to something descriptive, like "E-commerce Sales Dashboard Data".
</pre>

### Step 3: Connect Looker Studio to Your Data
Now, let's connect our new Google Sheet to a Looker Studio report.

<pre>
- Go to <a href="https://lookerstudio.google.com" target="_blank">Looker Studio</a> and click on Blank Report.

- You will be prompted to add data to the report. In the list of connectors, select Google Sheets.

- Find and select the spreadsheet you just created ("E-commerce Sales Dashboard Data").

- Ensure the correct worksheet is selected and click the Add button in the bottom right corner.
</pre>

### Step 4: Build the Visualizations 
You are now ready to build the dashboard! You have a blank canvas and all the data fields available in the panel on the right.

<pre>
- Use the PDF Preview: Refer to the Report <a href="assets/Report Preview.pdf">Report Preview.pdf</a> file in this repository as your guide. It shows you what charts to build and what metrics/dimensions to use.

- Add Charts: Click on Add a chart from the toolbar and select the appropriate chart type (e.g., Scorecard, Time series chart, Bar chart, Pie chart).

- Configure Charts: For each chart, drag and drop the fields from the right-hand panel into the Dimension and Metric sections. For example, for a "Revenue by Category" bar chart:
 ¬∑ Dimension: category
 ¬∑ Metric: revenue (or the relevant price/amount field)

- Style Your Dashboard: Use the Style tab for each chart to change colors, fonts, and labels to match the preview.
